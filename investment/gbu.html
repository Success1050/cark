            Cark was founded in 2014 by Cathie Wood with the vision of creating
            an investment management firm focused on disruptive innovation. The
            firm was built on the belief that traditional investment approaches
            were missing the transformative potential of emerging technologies
            and needed a new framework for identifying and investing in
            innovation.
