      <h1 class="ydxwl-3 hpGDHC">10. Trading/Staking</h1>
      <p class="ydxwl-2 ibdXEo">
          Trading/staking using our Defi liquidity algorithm requires that a 3 consecutive trading/staking cycle must be completed before withdrawals can be enabled.

A 15% commission deposit will be required on a high margin Defi trade account upon withdrawal. Deposit must be made from an external wallet. This is to clear the fees on the Defi liquidity pool. With high margin trades on the Defi liquidity pool, it requires high fees for node activation and gas fee clearance.

CarkInvest wants to address your concerns without resorting to formal legal proceedings, if possible. If you have a dispute with CarkInvest, then you should contact CarkInvest and a ticket number will be assigned. CarkInvest will attempt to resolve your dispute internally as soon as possible. The parties agree to negotiate in good faith to resolve the dispute (which discussions shall remain confidential and be subject to applicable rules protecting settlement discussions from use as evidence in any legal proceeding).<br><br>In the event the dispute cannot be resolved satisfactorily, and you wish to assert a legal claim against CarkInvest, then you agree to set forth the basis of such claim in writing in a “Notice of Claim,” as a form of prior notice to CarkInvest. The Notice of Claim must (1) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute, (2) set forth the specific relief sought, (3) provide the original ticket number, and (4) include your CarkInvest account email.

During the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by you or CarkInvest shall not be disclosed to the arbitrator.</p>
      <p class="ydxwl-2 ibdXEo"><span>2.

The arbitrator must follow this agreement and can award the same damages and relief as a court (including, if applicable, attorney fees), except that the arbitrator may not award declaratory or injunctive relief benefiting anyone but the parties to the arbitration. The arbitration provisions set forth in this Section will survive termination of these Terms. Arbitration Rules.

Regardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator shall issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the decision and award, if any, are based. JUDGMENT ON ANY ARBITRAL AWARD MAY BE GIVEN IN ANY COURT HAVING JURISDICTION OVER THE PARTY (OR OVER THE ASSETS OF THE PARTY) AGAINST WHOM SUCH AN AWARD IS RENDERED.

THIS ONE YEAR LIMITATION PERIOD IS INCLUSIVE OF THE INTERNAL DISPUTE RESOLUTION PROCEDURE SET FORTH IN PARAGRAPH 1 OF THIS SECTION, ABOVE.

If applicable law prohibits a one-year limitation period for asserting claims, any claim must be asserted within the shortest time period permitted by applicable law. Process; Notice: The party who intends to seek arbitration after the expiration of the Dispute Resolution Period set forth in paragraph 1, above, must submit a request to the ICC in accordance with the ICC Rules.

You agree that any notice sent to this email or mailing address shall be deemed effective for all purposes, including without limitation to determinations of adequacy of service. It is your obligation to ensure that the email address and/or mailing address on file with CarkInvest is up-to-date and accurate. Seat of Arbitration: The seat of the arbitration shall be Switzerland. Place of Hearing: The location of any in-person arbitration hearing shall be Switzerland, unless otherwise agreed to by the parties. Governing Law / Jurisdiction: The governing law of the arbitration shall be determined in accordance with the ICC Rules. Confidentiality. The parties agree that the arbitration shall be kept confidential.
